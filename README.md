## Project Overview and Goal
### Overview: 
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.
### Goal: 
Acquire a good understanding of the various data points, load Rockbuster's data into a relational database management system (RDBMS), query and analyze the data using SQL to answer departmental business questions, compile and visualize the results to present to the Rockbuster Stealth Management Board. 
## Key Questions and Objectives
